Online library management systems are becoming popular as they offer a convenient and efficient way for users to access library resources.
These systems typically use a combination of indexing and hashing to store and retrieve information about library materials. 
This project is aimed at developing an Online Library Management System for the college library and developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of library. 
This project mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new books, searching books, issuing books, display books, deleting books and facility to borrow and return books.
This project has many features which are generally not available in normal library management systems like. 
The add book module contains separate divisions like Book ID, Book Title, Author Name, Book status. 
Indexing is a technique that involves creating an index for quick access to specific data within a larger dataset. 
By implementing indexing, users can easily search and locate desired resources without scanning through the entire collection. 
Hashing, on the other hand, involves converting data into a unique identifier, or hash value, which is used for storage and retrieval purposes. 
In an online library management system, hashing can be utilized to assign each password a unique identifier. 
This hash value serves as a reference to quickly locate and access specific items within the system's database. 
Hashing ensures efficient storage and retrieval by minimizing the time required to search for and retrieve items. 
Combining indexing and hashing techniques in a file structure for an online library management system can significantly enhance the system's performance and user experience.
